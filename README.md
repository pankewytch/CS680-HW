These are my homework assignments for CS680 from my UMass Boston masters program in CS.

## HW1
This assignment includes the files:
1. HW1/src/edu/umb/cs680/hw01/PrimeGenerator.java
2. HW1/src/edu/umb/cs680/hw01/PrimeGeneratorTest.java
3. HW1/bin/edu/umb/cs680/hw01/PrimeGenerator.class
4. HW1/bin/edu/umb/cs680/hw01/PrimeGeneratorTest.class

## HW2-2
This assignment includes the following files:
1. HW2-2/hw02.xml
2. HW2-2/src/edu/umb/cs680/hw02/Calculator.java
3. HW2-2/test/src/edu/umb/cs680/hw02/CalculatorTest.java

## HW3
This assignment includes the following files:
1. HW3/build.xml
2. HW3/src/edu/umb/cs680/hw02/PrimeGenerator.java
3. HW2-2/test/src/edu/umb/cs680/hw02/PrimeGeneratorTest.java
Note, since the ant file is called build.xml one only needs to type ant in the terminal to build the project.
